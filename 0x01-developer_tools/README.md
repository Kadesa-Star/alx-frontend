Developer Tools
What Developer Tools in Your Browser Are:
Developer tools, often referred to as DevTools, are built-in web development aids in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari). These tools allow developers to inspect, edit, and debug their code directly within the browser.
Key components:
Elements panel (HTML/CSS inspection)
Console (JavaScript debugging)
Network (API requests, file loads)
Performance (page load speeds)
Lighthouse (audits and page optimization)
2. Opening Developer Tools in Different Browsers:
Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + Shift + I or F12
Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + I or F12
Safari: Option + Command + I (requires enabling from Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop menu)
Edge: F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I
3. Using the Elements Tab to Edit HTML and CSS:
This tab lets you inspect and modify the HTML structure and CSS styles of a webpage.
Tasks:
Right-click on an element and select "Inspect" to view its HTML.
Make live edits to text and CSS properties to see immediate changes.
Use the Styles panel to add or modify CSS.
4. Auditing a Page with Lighthouse:
Lighthouse is a tool to audit and assess a website's performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.
Task:
Open DevTools > Lighthouse.
Run an audit for either mobile or desktop, and review areas like page speed and performance improvements.
5. Creating and Running Snippets:
Snippets are reusable pieces of JavaScript code that you can execute on any webpage.
Task:
Go to Sources > Snippets > Create a new snippet.
Write and run small JavaScript programs, such as logging to the console or manipulating DOM elements.
6. Getting Information About Files and Server Configurations:
Use the Network tab to observe file requests, including JavaScript, CSS, and API requests.
Tasks:
Check for request headers, status codes, and payload information.
Identify file sizes, request times, and any failed requests.
7. Blocking Requests:
Use DevTools to block specific requests (e.g., JavaScript files or images) to test website behavior.
Task:
In the Network tab, right-click a file > Block request URL to prevent loading.
8. Determining How Much JavaScript or CSS is Used on a Page:
Coverage tool in Chrome allows you to see unused CSS and JavaScript on a page.
Task:
Open the Coverage tool from the Command menu (Ctrl + Shift + P) and run it while interacting with the page.
Review what percentage of code is used vs. unused.
9. Detecting 404 Errors:
Network tab allows you to inspect failed requests, especially 404 (Not Found) errors.
Task:
Filter network requests to check for any 404 errors, and track the resource URL that failed to load.
10. Moving Elements on a Webpage:
In the Elements tab, you can drag-and-drop elements within the DOM.
Task:
Select an element, then click and drag it to a different location in the DOM tree, and observe the live change.
