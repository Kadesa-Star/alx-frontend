* Advanced HTML Project - Techium
** Project Overview
Welcome to the Advanced HTML project, part of the Web Stack specialization. This project focuses on using HTML tags to properly structure a webpage. No styling is involved at this stage, so the final page may not look visually appealing—but that’s intentional. The main goal is to master the structural and semantic aspects of HTML.

* Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

Understand and apply HTML guidelines.
Create the skeleton of an HTML5 page.
Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., header, main, footer, article, nav, section, aside).
Differentiate between div and span and understand their use cases.
Organize headings *(<h1> to <h6>)* in a hierarchical manner.
Create ordered and unordered lists.
Understand and implement different media types (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG).
Structure data in tables.
Embed video and audio files on a webpage.
Correctly embed external content using iframes and other methods.
Key Concepts
HTML5 syntax and structure.
Semantic HTML.
Media integration (images, videos, audio).
Tables, forms, and embedding external content.
Best practices in accessibility and SEO.
Requirements
All HTML code should be W3C-compliant and validated using the W3C Validator.
The company name Techium will be used across all the pages.
A README.md file must be included at the root of the project folder.
